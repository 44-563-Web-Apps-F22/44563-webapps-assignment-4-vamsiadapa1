    <h2>Opera 2</h2>
<h4 class="GROS" > GROS</h4> <P class="directions">  At last they are gone!  What is this mysterious
fascination that I seem to exercise over all I come across?  A
curse on my fatal beauty, for I am sick of conquests!  [Goes R.]

[Enter PATIENCE, L. Stops L.C. on seeing GROSVENOR.]</P>

<h4 class="GROS" > GROS</h4>  <P class="speech"> [Turns and sees her.]  Patience!</P>

<h4 class="PATIENCE">PATIENCE</h4> <P class="speech">  I have escaped with difficulty from my Reginald.  I
wanted to see you so much that I might ask you if you still love
me as fondly as ever?</P>

<h4 class="GROS" > GROS</h4> <P class="directions">  Love you?  If the devotion of a lifetime— [seizing her
hand.]</P>

<h4 class="PATIENCE">PATIENCE</h4> <p class="directions">[indignantly]  Hold!  Unhand me, or I scream!  [He
releases her.]  If you are a gentleman, pray remember that I am
another's!  [very tenderly.]  But you do love me, don't you?</p>

<h4 class="GROS" > GROS</h4> <P class="speech">  Madly, hopelessly, despairingly!</P>

<h4 class="PATIENCE">PATIENCE</h4>  <p class ="speech">  That's right!  I never can be yours; but that's right!</p>
<h4 class="GROS" > GROS</h4> <P class="directions"> And you love this Bunthorne?</P>


<h4 class="PATIENCE">PATIENCE</h4>  <p class ="speech">  Sir! this language to one who is promised to another!
[tenderly]  Oh, Archibald, think of me sometimes, for my heart is
breaking!  He is unkind to me, and you would be so loving!</p>

<h4 class="GROSVENOR">GRONSVENOR</h4>  <p class ="song"> sighs, gazes sorrowfully at her, sighs deeply, and
     exits, R.  She bursts into tears.

Enter BUNTHORNE, followed by JANE.  He is moody and
     preoccupied.
                       In a doleful train
                             (Duet)
                              Jane
                 In a doleful train
               One and one I walk all day;
          For I love in vain—
               None so sorrowful as they
                    Who can only sigh and say,
                    Woe is me, alackaday!</p>

<h4 class="BUN">BUN</h4> <P class="speech"> [seeing PATIENCE]  Crying, eh?  What are you crying about?</P>

<h4 class="PATIENCE">PATIENCE</h4>  <p class ="speech"> I've only been thinking how dearly I love you!</p>



<h4 class="JANE">JANE</h4> <P class="speech"> Love him!  Bah! </P>

<h4 class="BUN">BUN</h4> <P class="directions"> [to JANE]  Don't you interfere.

     He always crushes me!</p>
 
<h4 class="BUNTHORNE">BUNTHORNE</h4>  <p class="song">noticing that JANE is not looking at him, goes off
     quickly up R.  She turns, sees him, and runs after him.]
                No. 14. Love is a plaintive song
                             (Solo)</p>
                   <p class="song">         Patience
             Love is a plaintive song,
               Sung by a suff'ring maid,
          Telling a tale of wrong,
               Telling of hope betrayed;
          Tuned to each changing note,
               Sorry when he is sad,
          Blind to his ev'ry mote,
               Merry when he is glad!
               Merry when he is glad!
                    Love that no wrong can cure,
                        Love that is always new,
                    That is the love that's pure,
                        That is the love that's true!
                    Love that no wrong can cure,
                        Love that is always new,
                    That is the love that's pure,
                        That is the love, the love that's true!
