    <h4 class="act scene"> ACT 1</h4>  <p class="directions"> [SCENE — A wooded glade, with a view of open country in the
      background.The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
      distance.  JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello,
      which she has propped up on a tree-stump, L., and upon which
      she will presently accompany herself.  As the Chorus ends,
      she speaks.]</p>

         <h4 class="GROS">GROS</h4> <p class="directions">[sighing]  Yes, child, if you will.  What shall I read? </p>       
         <h4 class="ANGELA">ANGELA<h4>  <p class="speech"> One of your own poems. </p>
         <h4 class="GROS">GROS</h4>  <p class="directions">One of my own poems?  Better not, my child.  They will not

         No. 10. On such eyes as maidens cherish
         (Opening Chorus)</p>

            <p class="song">Maidens

On such eyes as maidens cherish
     Lest thy fond adorers gaze,
Or incontinently perish,
     In their all-consuming rays!
Or incontinently perish,
     In their all-consuming rays!
JANE  The fickle crew have deserted Reginald and sworn allegiance
to his rival, and all, forsooth, because he has glanced with
passing favour on a puling milkmaid!  Fools!  Of that fancy he
will soon weary — and then, I, who alone am faithful to him,
shall reap my reward.  But do not dally too long, Reginald, for
my charms are ripe, Reginald, and already they are decaying.
Better secure me ere I have gone too far!
 No. 11. Sad is that woman's lot</p>
       
         <h4 class="SAPHIR">SAPHIR</h4>  <p class="speech">And, to do him justice, he read them extremely well.</p>
         <h4 class="GROS">GROS</h4>   <p class="speech">I believe I am right in saying that there is not one word
         in that decalet which is calculated to bring the blush of shame
         to the cheek of modesty.</p>

              Teasing Tom was a very bad boy,
              A great big squirt was his favourite toy
              He put live shrimps in his father's boots,
              And sewed up the sleeves of his Sunday suits;
              He punched his poor little sisters' heads,
              And cayenne-peppered their four-post beds;
              He plastered their hair with cobbler's wax,
              And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs.
              ANGELA  Marked you how grandly — how relentlessly — the damning
              catalogue of crime strode on, till Retribution, like a poised
              hawk, came swooping down upon the Wrong-Doer?  Oh, it was
              terrible!  [All shudder.]</p>
            
              <h4 class="ELLA">ELLA</h4>   <p class="speech">Oh, sir, you are indeed a true poet, for you touch our
              hearts, and they go out to you!</p>
            
              <h4 class="GROS">GROS</h4>.   <p class="directions">[aside]  This is simply cloying.  [aloud] Ladies, I am
              sorry to appear ungallant, but this is Saturday, and you have
              been following me about ever since Monday.  I should like the
              usual half-holiday.  I shall take it as a personal favour if you
              will kindly allow me to close early to-day.</p>

              <h4 class="GROSVENOR">GROSVENOR</h4>     <p class="speech"> A magnet hung in a hardware shop,
              And all around was a loving crop
              Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,
              Offering love for all their lives;
              But for iron the magnet felt no whim,
              Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him;
              From needles and nails and knives he'd turn,
              For he'd set his love on a Silver Churn!</p>

             <h4 class="MAIDENS">MAIDENS</h4>          <p class="speech"> A Silver Churn!</p>

                       Very magnetic
                   Fancy took this turn—
                       "If I can wheedle
                       A knife or a needle,
                   Why not a Silver Churn?" </p>

               And Iron and Steel expressed surprise,
               The needles opened their well-drilled eyes,
               The penknives felt "shut up", no doubt,
               The scissors declared themselves "cut out",
         The kettles they boiled with rage, 'tis said,
         While ev'ry nail went off its head,
         And hither and thither began to roam,
         Till a hammer came up and drove them home.</p>
