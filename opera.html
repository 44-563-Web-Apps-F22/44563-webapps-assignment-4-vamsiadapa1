    <h3>opera</h3>
    <h5>[ACT1 SCENE — A wooded glade, with a view of open country in the
      background.  The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
      distance.  JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello,
      which she has propped up on a tree-stump, L., and upon which
      she will presently accompany herself.  As the Chorus ends,
      she speaks.]</h5>
      <P>ANGELA  Sir, will it please you read to us?

         GROS. [sighing]  Yes, child, if you will.  What shall I read?
       
         ANGELA  One of your own poems.
       
         GROS.  One of my own poems?  Better not, my child.  They will not
         cure thee of thy love.  [All sigh.]
       
         ELLA  Mr. Bunthorne used to read us a poem of his own every day.
       
         SAPHIR  And, to do him justice, he read them extremely well.
         GROS.  I believe I am right in saying that there is not one word
         in that decalet which is calculated to bring the blush of shame
         to the cheek of modesty.
       
         ANGELA  Not one; it is purity itself.
       
         GROS.  Here's another.
       
              Teasing Tom was a very bad boy,
              A great big squirt was his favourite toy
              He put live shrimps in his father's boots,
              And sewed up the sleeves of his Sunday suits;
              He punched his poor little sisters' heads,
              And cayenne-peppered their four-post beds;
              He plastered their hair with cobbler's wax,
              And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs.
              ANGELA  Marked you how grandly — how relentlessly — the damning
              catalogue of crime strode on, till Retribution, like a poised
              hawk, came swooping down upon the Wrong-Doer?  Oh, it was
              terrible!  [All shudder.]
            
              ELLA  Oh, sir, you are indeed a true poet, for you touch our
              hearts, and they go out to you!
            
              GROS. [aside]  This is simply cloying.  [aloud] Ladies, I am
              sorry to appear ungallant, but this is Saturday, and you have
              been following me about ever since Monday.  I should like the
              usual half-holiday.  I shall take it as a personal favour if you
              will kindly allow me to close early to-day.
            
              SAPHIR  Oh, sir, do not send us from you!
            
              GROSVENOR      A magnet hung in a hardware shop,
              And all around was a loving crop
              Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,
              Offering love for all their lives;
              But for iron the magnet felt no whim,
              Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him;
              From needles and nails and knives he'd turn,
              For he'd set his love on a Silver Churn!

             MAIDENS             A Silver Churn!

             GROSVENOR           A Silver Churn!

                       His most aesthetic,
                       Very magnetic
                   Fancy took this turn—
                       "If I can wheedle
                       A knife or a needle,
                   Why not a Silver Churn?"

             MAIDENS                 His most aesthetic,
                       Very magnetic
                   Fancy took this turn—
                       "If I can wheedle
                       A knife or a needle,
                   Why not a Silver Churn?"

             GROSVENOR [He rises, going C.]
               And Iron and Steel expressed surprise,
               The needles opened their well-drilled eyes,
               The penknives felt "shut up", no doubt,
               The scissors declared themselves "cut out",
         The kettles they boiled with rage, 'tis said,
         While ev'ry nail went off its head,
         And hither and thither began to roam,
         Till a hammer came up and drove them home.

MAIDENS        It drove them home?

GROSVENOR      It drove them home!

                   While this magnetic,
                   Peripatetic
              Lover he lived to learn,
                   By no endeavour
                   Can magnet ever
              Attract a Silver Churn!

MAIDENS             While this magnetic,
                   Peripatetic
              Lover he lived to learn,

MAIDENS and
GROSVENOR      By no endeavour
                   Can magnet ever
              Attract a Silver Churn!

[They go off in low spirits, R.U.E., gazing back at him from time
    to time.]

GROS.  At last they are gone!  What is this mysterious
fascination that I seem to exercise over all I come across?  A
curse on my fatal beauty, for I am sick of conquests!  [Goes R.]

[Enter PATIENCE, L. Stops L.C. on seeing GROSVENOR.]

GROS. [Turns and sees her.]  Patience!

PATIENCE  I have escaped with difficulty from my Reginald.  I
wanted to see you so much that I might ask you if you still love
me as fondly as ever?

GROS.  Love you?  If the devotion of a lifetime— [seizing her
hand.]

PATIENCE [indignantly]  Hold!  Unhand me, or I scream!  [He
releases her.]  If you are a gentleman, pray remember that I am
another's!  [very tenderly.]  But you do love me, don't you?
